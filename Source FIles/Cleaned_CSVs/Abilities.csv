Each time such a model is selected to shoot in the Shooting phase, you can select up to x models embarked within it whose units have not already shot this phase. Then, for each of those embarked models, you can select one ranged weapon that embarked model is equipped with (excluding weapons with the [ONE SHOT] ability). Until that TRANSPORT model has resolved all of its attacks, it counts as being equipped with all of the weapons you selected in this way, in addition to its other weapons. Until the end of the phase, those selected models units are not eligible to shoot.Firing Deck x: Each time this TRANSPORT shoots, select one weapon (excluding weapons with the [ONE SHOT] ability) from up to x models embarked within it whose units have not shot this phase; this TRANSPORT counts as being equipped with those weapons as well.

Each time a model with this ability suffers damage and so would lose a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the number denoted by x, that wound is ignored and is not lost. If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, you can only use one of those abilities each time that model suffers damage and so would lose a wound.Feel No Pain x+: Each time this model would lose a wound, roll one D6: if the result equals or exceeds x, that wound is not lost.|

On a 6, each unit within 6"" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by x (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6"").Example: A TRANSPORT model with the Deadly Demise D3 ability is destroyed. Before any models disembark and before removing it from play, its controlling player rolls one D6, getting a 6. There are three units within 6"" of that destroyed model, so its controlling player rolls one D3 for each of them, inflicting mortal wounds accordingly.Deadly Demise x: When this model is destroyed, roll one D6.

When you are instructed to Declare Battle Formations, before doing anything else, you must first declare which models from your army with this ability will be in Hover mode.If a model is in Hover mode, then until the end of the battle, its Move characteristic is changed to 20"", it loses the AIRCRAFT keyword and it loses all associated rules for being an AIRCRAFT model. Models in Hover mode do not start the battle in Reserves, but you can choose to place them into Strategic Reserves following the normal rules if you wish."|
8343|Deep Strike|Some units make their way to battle via tunnelling, teleportation, high-altitude descent or other extraordinary means that allow them to appear suddenly in the thick of the fighting.||"DEEP STRIKESome units make their way to battle via tunnelling, teleportation, high-altitude descent or other extraordinary means that allow them to appear suddenly in the thick of the fighting.During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9"" horizontally away from all enemy models. If a unit with the Deep Strike ability arrives from Strategic Reserves, the controlling player can choose for that unit to be set up either using the rules for Strategic Reserves or using the Deep Strike ability.

Unnoticed by the enemy, they range ahead of the main force.Some units have Scouts x"" listed in their abilities. If every model in a unit has this ability, then at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to x"", with the exception that, while making that move, the distance moved by each model in that unit can be greater than that model's Move characteristic, as long as it is not greater than x"".DEDICATED TRANSPORT models can make use of any Scouts x"" ability listed in their abilities, or a Scouts x"" ability that a unit that starts the battle embarked within that DEDICATED TRANSPORT model has (provided only models with this ability are embarked within that DEDICATED TRANSPORT model), regardless of how that embarked unit gained this ability (e.g. listed in their abilities, conferred by an Enhancement or by an attached CHARACTER, etc.).A unit that moves using this ability must end that move more than 9"" horizontally away from all enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their units first.Example: A unit has the Scouts 6"" ability. At the start of the first battle round, the controlling player can make a Normal move with that unit of up to 6"".Scouts x"": Unit can make a Normal move of up to x"" before the first turn begins.If embarked in a DEDICATED TRANSPORT, that DEDICATED TRANSPORT can make this move instead.Must end this move more than 9"" horizontally away from all enemy models."|

8346|Leader|Mighty heroes fight at the forefront of battle.||LEADERMighty heroes fight at the forefront of battle.Some CHARACTER units have Leader listed on their datasheets. Such CHARACTER units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead  known as their Bodyguard units  are listed on their datasheet.During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leaders Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.Each time the last model in a CHARACTER unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another CHARACTER unit attached, that Attached units Bodyguard unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks. Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.|

Witch lights flare back to life within dead eye-lenses and the Necron rises again, shambling back into their battle line. Those Necrons too catastrophically damaged to reform vanish instead, teleported away to their tombs for repair. |NEC|If your Army Faction is NECRONS, at the end of your Command phase, each unit from your army with this ability that is on the battlefield activates its Reanimation Protocols and reanimates D3 wounds.

8507|Power from Pain|The Drukhari feed on suffering and terror. Every arc of blood that jets from a blade-slit artery, every scream of agonised horror, every vertiginous moment of shock or despair experienced by their prey surges through the Drukhari like an intoxicant. As the battle rages, the denizens of the Dark City drink deep of the floodtide of pain. Sinews singing with stolen strength, motions blurred to preternatural swiftness, they howl in exhilarated bloodlust and fight all the harder to extract yet sweeter agonies from those who dare resist them.|DRU|Pain AbilitiesAll Drukhari units have a Pain ability, tagged with the word Pain. Pain abilities only apply to a unit while it is Empowered. If your Army Faction is DRUKHARI, you can Empower units from your army with Pain abilities by spending Pain tokens (see below).Designers Note: You can also spend Pain tokens to activate additional effects in certain other rules such as Enhancements and Stratagems.Gaining Pain TokensIf your Army Faction is DRUKHARI, you gain Pain tokens as follows:1 Pain token at the start of your Command phase.1 Pain token each time an enemy unit is destroyed.1 Pain token each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test.Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side - this is your Pain token pool. Each time you spend a Pain token, reduce your Pain token pool by the same amount.Empowered Through PainEach Pain ability will state when you can spend Pain tokens to Empower that unit. When you do, until the end of the phase, that unit is Empowered and all Pain abilities it has take effect. While an Attached unit is Empowered, the Pain abilities of all Leader and Bodyguard units in that unit take effect - you do not need to spend additional Pain tokens to activate each of those Pain abilities.Example: At the start of your Charge phase, you spend 1 Pain token to Empower a unit of Wyches. The unit becomes Empowered, and so its Acrobatic Gladiators ability takes effect until the end of the phase. A Succubus is leading the unit, and so its Lithe Agility ability also takes effect until the end of the phase (no additional Pain token is required to activate that ability as well).|

8536|Designers Note||TL|Designers Note: Titans are colossal war machines that can turn the tide of battle. As such, the points values of some of these models are greater than even Onslaught-sized battles can accommodate; they are designed for battlefields of the most apocalyptic scale you can imagine!|
8537|Unaligned Forces||UN|You can include UNALIGNED FORCES units in your army even if they do not have the Faction keyword you selected in the Select Army Faction step.

During the battle, which ability those LEAGUES OF VOTANN units have will change depending on how many Yield points (YP) you currently have:At the start of the battle, your units have Hostile Acquisition until the start of your next Command phase.At the end of your Command phase, if you have fewer than 7YP, your units have Hostile Acquisition until the start of your next Command phase.At the end of your Command phase, if you have 7YP or more, your units have Fortify Takeover until the start of your next Command phase.Hostile AcquisitionEach time a model in this unit makes an attack that targets an enemy unit within range of one or more objective markers, add 1 to the Hit roll.You can re-roll Advance and Charge rolls made for this unit.Fortify TakeoverEach time a model in this unit makes an attack that targets an enemy unit, if this unit is within range of one or more objective markers you control, add 1 to the Hit roll.Each time an attack targets this unit, if the Strength characteristic of that attack is greater than this units Toughness characteristic and this unit is not a VEHICLE, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.Yield PointsAt the end of each players Command phase, you gain 1YP if you control one or more objective markers within your deployment zone, and, from the second battle round onwards, you gain 1 additional YP for each of the following conditions you satisfy:You control one or more objective markers not within your deployment zone.You control two or more objective markers not within your deployment zone.You control more objective markers than your opponent.In your turn, YP gained in this way are always gained before checking which ability LEAGUES OF VOTANN units from your army have.Whenever a rule allows you to spend YP, reduce the number of YP you have by that amount (your YP cannot go below 0), otherwise you cannot use that rule.Designers Note: This means you can use rules that let you gain or spend YP to influence which ability your units have - Hostile Acquisition or Fortify Takeover - depending on which will be most beneficial to you. Remember that your army only changes ability at the end of your Command phase, so you will - sometimes need to plan ahead if you want your army to stay in or change ability.Example: In her third turn, Freidas units had the Hostile Acquisition ability, as she had 6YP at the end of her Command phase. In her fourth turn, at the end of her Command phase, she controls one objective marker within her deployment zone, and one objective marker not within her deployment zone, and her opponent controls two objective markers. Freida gains 2YP, so she now has 8YP, and her units now have the Fortify Takeover ability instead.During her turn, Freida uses a Stratagem that allows her to spend YP. She spends 2YP, bringing her total down to 6YP. However, units from her army still have Fortify Takeover - it will only change if, at the end of her next Command phase, she still has fewer than 7YP.|
