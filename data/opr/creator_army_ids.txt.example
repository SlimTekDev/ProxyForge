# Creator army IDs (only used when official_army_ids.txt does NOT exist).
# One armyId per line. When official_army_ids.txt exists, source is determined by
# that allowlist instead (see build_official_army_ids.py and official_army_ids.txt).
# Example (replace with real creator army IDs from OPR):
# abc123creator1
# def456creator2
